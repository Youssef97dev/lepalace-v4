    "content_1": "At Le Palace, where everything from the French-inspired food (and the prices) are over the top, the opulent decor is matched only by the clientele.",
    "content_2": "The lighting throughout the space is rich and warm, and the owner, Nordine Fakir, credits it for much of the restaurantâ€™s success. Most diners begin the evening sitting inside, but then make their way to the boudoir-esque basement, festooned in photos of Yves Saint Laurent, and where dancing on the furniture goes late into the night."
